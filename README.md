# Pure Copper Tools

Pure Copper Tools is yet another copper tools and armor mod that strives to fit the Vanilla style as closely as possible. All colors have been derived from the Vanilla blocks, and the item statistics were thoughtfully curated to be interesting and useful while not overlapping other materials. 

This mod is intended to be used alongside my other mods, which I'm calling "micro-mods". I aim to combat bloated, overproduced mods with my simplistic, segmented micro-mods. Curate your own features without editing confusing config files and disabling recipes. Check my profile to find more mods, and complete your pack!
